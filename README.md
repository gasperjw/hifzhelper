## Hifdh Helper | An Assistant to Quran Memorization

Project Goal
To assist in memorizing the Quran by finding and presenting verses similar to the one the user is currently memorizing. This can help in understanding the context and variations in Quranic themes and aid in memorization by association.

Project Information
This application is designed to support Quran memorization efforts by retrieving and displaying verses similar to the user's current focus. It utilizes a database of Quranic verses and advanced search techniques to find related ayahs (verses).

Technologies Used
LLM (Large Language Models): For processing queries and understanding the context of the verses.
BERT Encoding and Cosine Similarity: Determining which verses are similar
Streamlit: For creating the web interface of the application.
How it Works
The user inputs a verse or keywords from a verse they are memorizing.
The app processes the query to understand the context and searches for similar verses.
The relevant verses are then displayed on the app interface, helping the user in memorization by providing related context and themes.
